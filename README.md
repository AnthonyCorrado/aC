## aleC (secret working title...or is it??? Spoiler: it is)

A notification service used by bars to spread the joy of new or returning microbrews! Currently, only deployable on Android devices.

## Why and How

You know the old love story...A patron falls for the Blonde IPA microbrew down at the local pub. Patron goes home and tells friends and family about meeting "The One." Said patron brings friends to bar the following weekend only to discover the soul crushing news that the heralded beer is not available at this time. Tragic.

aleC wants to make this sad sob story a thing of the past. Bar managers and bartenders merely have to select the beer that is back on tap and aleC sends text or email notifications based on the patron's preferences. Bars increase repeat business. Patrons head to the bar for a few pints of their favorite brew with friends. Tragedy averted.

## What Was Used

The awesomely powerful Ionic Framework with Angular.js client-side baked in, Firebase backend service and DB, and Belching Beaver Peanut Butter Milk Stout which served as the inspiration for aleC.
